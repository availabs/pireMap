Essex County Communication Tower in Clinton Co, on Terry Mountain
1159 Peasleeville Rd
Scjyler Falls, NY
44.574266, -73.674855","Updated on this report from yesterday. This 760-foot communication Tower is located within Clinton County, but owned and maintained by Essex County for their emergency radio service.  The road from Peasleeville road to the tower traverses through State land but is maintained by Essex County.  The tower provides communication for State Police, Essex County and Clinton County Emergency Services, and NYSEG.  There are additional antennas on this tower owned by commercial communication companies.  Essex County receives revenue from these commercial companies for the use of the tower. During the Oct 31 storm the microwave communication from the town was disrupted and power was lost causing emergency generators to take over.  After the storm microwave service was partially restored but at a degraded signal level and quality than before the storm.  Fuel needed to be delivered to the site to keep the generators running until power could be restored.  Special four wheeled vehicles were pulled into service to deliver this fuel.  An Essex County contractor was tasked to assess the damages to the tower and determined that the topmost guy wires holding the tower in place were serous sagging beyond normal and required re-tensioning.  Additionally, a piece of equipment from a shorter tower next to the 760-foot town was blown off and damaged the roof of the fuel storage shed.  The steep two plus mile dirt road from Peasleeville Road to the tower was seriously scoured and rendered impassible to vehicles that normally deliver materials and fuel to the site.  The cost to repair the damage to the road was estimated by the Clinton County EM and the Clinton County Highway Superintendent.  The following costs and estimates to restore the site to pre-disaster condition are as follows: 
- Delivery of fuel for generators $4K
RS Telecom, Inc. Terryu Mt Realignment and test $6739.28 - Adjusted Cost
- Mid State CE, Inc Terry Mt Realignment $7929
- Road repair $125,000
- Re-tensioning guy wire cables $32,000 (11/19/19 received quote lower than original estimate)
- Antenna Alignment $15,000
- Repair to Fuel shed roof $7,500K
-Generator running 80 hours $3488 (11/19/19 new cost added)
-Cost to restore Utility Pwer to the mountain $5000 (new cost added 11/19/19)
-Estimated cost to hire a company to remove a damaged tree threatening power line- $8,000
